# Problem Statement

## Introduction

This data set is a **masked data set** which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA and data visualisation. 

 

## Business Understanding

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?

 

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.
