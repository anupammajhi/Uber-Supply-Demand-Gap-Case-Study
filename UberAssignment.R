      #Explanation : For above two graphs tile (heat map) is used to confirm the hypothesis of status irrespective of day, 
      # labs has been used to change graph labels,
      # Text not used to keep it clean and simple and to find obvious inferences
      # scale_fill_gradient used to change colors of tiles
      #labs used to rename labels
      
      #Verdict : For ABOVE TWO GRAPHS, Based on Time and Day we can see that irrespective of which day, the response to demand is same.
      #          Hence further confirming the hypothesis
